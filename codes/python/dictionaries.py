# dictionaries are used to map some value to some other volume

houses = {"Harry:" "Gryfon" "Draco:" "Slytherin"}
# this line creates a dictionary, that is, if I look at Harry I see Gryfon and if I look at Draco I see Slytherin

# alternitevely:
houses["Hermione"] = "Gryfon"

print(houses["Harry"])
# output will be: Gryfon
